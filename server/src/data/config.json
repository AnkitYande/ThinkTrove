  "additionalInstructions": "Scenario: The student is a sociologist investigating a local community that has recently become unusually divided and argumentative. Initially, no direct cause is given—students should observe patterns of discussion, conflicts, and the spread of ideas. Over time, evidence should reveal that certain content is being repeatedly amplified and that the extreme division is not just due to individual choices. Students should hypothesize about underlying causes, test these hypotheses by examining patterns and discrepancies, and ultimately infer that a new mechanism (a social media platform's algorithm) is intensifying the polarization. Guide students to distinguish between individual behavior and systemic amplification, analyze the effects on community dynamics, and reflect on how unseen mechanisms influence social opinion."
